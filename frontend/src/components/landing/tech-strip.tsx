 * The dependency strip.

 * implying adoption that does not exist would be the dishonest version of a
 * logo wall.
 *
 * Set as bare wordmarks rather than brand SVGs. Faking a mark is worse than
 * omitting it, and only some of these have an official one that could be
 * reproduced faithfully — so none of them get a drawn approximation.
